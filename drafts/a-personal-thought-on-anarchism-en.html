Anarchism does not advocate a state—in the original sense of the word—of anomy. But it is the State which perpetuates violence and disorder. Anarchy means the absence of both the State and the laws. Élisée Reclus would see it as the “higher expression of order.”</p><p>Anarchism is not an anti-social nor individualist thought. On the contrary, anarchism represents the wish of a fair and free society, which can be reached only through the real freedom of the individuals whom society consists of. A fair and free society cannot be based on coercion. However, real freedom does not mean the power of doing what one wants at the expense of the others' freedom. Real and fair freedom is also for one to willfully set restraints to its freedom, without them being commanded by any authority.</p><p>Nowadays, anarchism is caricatured by those who cannot conceive of an organised and fair society without institutions such as private property, the State or the police, that most of anarchists reject. The republican ideology, statist and nationalist, prevails in the political discourse, wether on left-wing or right-wing, and it does not cease to be taught by its institutions, the first of them we face being the so-called “republican” school.</p><p>Anarchy is not equal to a society based on the survival of the fittest, as we may be often told being an anarchist or related to. This principle that “might is right”, we currently know it, strengthened by the capitalist mode of production and its neo-liberal version. Survival of the fittest will cease when we understand that competition and rivalry between individuals must give way to free cooperation. The end of its existence will be sealed by the withdrawal of the society based on classes, supposed races or privileged models of sexuality and gender. In short, when domination of some over others is nothing more than a bad memory.</p><p>Anarchism is not utopist nor extremist, but it is radical, which means it considers the resolution of issues at their roots. We do not stop the boiling water from making the pot overflow differently than by turning the fire off. Thus, we cannot settle for wanting to solve issues which roots are deeply buried in our society's structures by amending or hacking them, but by destroying them to rebuild some better. We cannot reach social justice through laws or authoritarian institutions, for it would jeopardise our freedom as individuals. Thus, it is futile to blindly trust reformist projects such as rewriting the constitution and reforming the Republic.</p><p>We cannot settle for legal actions in order to reach our aspirations, that is, social justice and freedom. Overtaking the State must be done through realizing that its existence is not inavoidable nor essential, and that all of what results from it is no panacea. Overtaking the State also means overtaking its rules if they are in conflict with social justice and freedom.</p><p>We cannot give in to anti-intellectualism nor to contempt for class. Knowledge must be open to everyone without being commanded to them. The only essential knowledge is that of skepticism and questioning, particularly regarding what seems obvious and acknowledged. For that knowledge allows us to analyse the ideological discourse without being leveraged by something other than our sole belief, and to know, to spot and finally to overtake the bias imposed to our thought by our position within the social hierarchy.</p><p>We must decline every form of eugenics, in particular intellectual eugenics. Ambition can also work in the “refusal to make it” way, which can be a sign of wisdom and solidarity more than social failure or stupidity.</p><p>We must not think that our opinion, our thought, can embrace an ideology in its entirety. What matters is not to be exemplary nor to be the goog learner of some “<em>dire-vrai</em>” (tell-true), but to ensure consistency with our belief. Socrates would tell us that think is such as talk to oneself, and that what matters is not to agree with everyone around the world but rather to agree with oneself. Thus, anarchism, if it is based on some common principles, has nothing to do with a settled ideology. On the contrary, it is designed to be figured continuously.</p><p>This thought does not tackle neither all of the topics which can be analyzed with an anarchist point of view nor all of the forms that anarchism can take. This may constitute another post on this web-log.</p></article><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/en/">English version</a></li><li>:: <a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/pages/contact.html">contact</a></li><li>:: <a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/pages/uncopyright.html">uncopyright</a></li><li> :: <a href="https://github.com/Bricabraque">github</a></li></ul></nav></footer></div></body></html>
