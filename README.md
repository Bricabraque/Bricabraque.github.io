#Bricabrac

Bricabrac is my personal web-log hosted on [Graine d'utopie](https://grainedutopie.eu). It's meant to be a digital place where I can write whatever I want, whenever I want. A tiny island of anarchy lost within the immensity of Internet.

Writings are CC-0 and written in both English and French, the latter being my mothertongue. Website is GPLv3 and based on [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/).

You can find the Pelican theme [here](https://github.com/Bricabraque/bricabrac-pelican-theme).
