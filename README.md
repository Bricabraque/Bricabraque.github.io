#Bricabrac
Bricabrac is my personal web-log hosted on [Graine d'utopie](https://grainedutopie.eu). It's meant to be a digital place where I can write whatever I want, whenever I want. An tiny island of anarchy lost within the immensity of Internet.

Have a look if you can read French ! -- Though I translate my texts in English most of the time --
