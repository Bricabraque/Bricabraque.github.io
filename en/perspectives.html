<p>I do not like to work. At least, I do not like to work when constrained by a hierarchy ; under pressure from the competitive relationship between companies, the sacrosanct principle of economic liberalism and capitalist mode of production ; burdened by the weight of an unpleasant and unfulfilling job.</p>
<p>To make these consideratons while we are still a student without any working experience but a few internship and roughly two or three seasonal contracts is likely to make you feel down. Not yet fully entered in the labour market as an employee but already blasé.</p>
<p>Actually no. I am talking about being an employee, but when you are a student with all the doors that are still open to you—thanks to your educational level—people are trying to lure you with other shapes of alienation at work: self-entrepreneurship, academic research or teaching, even 'ethical' wage-earning within young, trendy, dynamic, bio-friendly, leftist-but-not-too-far-because-extremes-are-evil companies.</p>
<p>And this is what I want to talk about: this situation where, because of your academic educational background and a fortiori your cultural capital, you are to enter, unwillingly, the hybrid class which some would call the medium class: aware of the upper class privilege, but not aware of theirs ; aware of environmental, political and social issues, but without appreciate their incidence on the said issues. </p>
<p>Here are the questions I am hardly able to answer to being a student and considering my beliefs: can I follow the pattern which I have been pre-determined to follow since I reached college—research and teaching—while maintaining a class consciousness? Aren't I to forget unavoidably that the acamedic status would have provided me new privilege to enjoy? Will I still have an enough critical thinking to take into account my social position in my vision in order not to be biased by a social confinement?</p>
<p>My fear is precisely that of believing that my educational level would allow me to work and still have a fulfilling life, because I would have the opportunity to do something that pleases me. For it is exactly the feeling that I get from the medium class, to which I already belong more or less: that of a class which is not aware of its position within the social hierarchy. This blindness is doubtless one of the reasons why any revolutionary process remains impossible today: how can it be possible to envisage another society whitout being conscious of the alienations from which we suffer and that we inflict to the others? Above all, how can it be possible to realize the urgent need of a societal shift?</p>
<p>In a sense, my interrogations about my immediate future illustrate the class struggle on my scale: even though I can find a strictly intellectual interest in pursuing my education up to the PhD and take pleasure in it, pride is also likely to make me seek a higher social status. I always refer this very consideration to an article published on an issue of CQFD, titled <a href="http://cqfd-journal.org/Refus-de-parvenir">"Le refus de parvenir"</a> (Iffik Le Guen, avril 2016), discussing the conscious refusal of seeking a higher social status within a system, quite often through work: kinf of an inverted ambition.</p>
<p>Should I follow my interest in intellectual knowledge while hoping to keep my critical eye and my class consciousness, and use this knowledge in concrete forms of resistance, or should I turn now to more basic projects and closer to the struggle in a perspective of refusal to contribute to a system which revulses me?</p>
