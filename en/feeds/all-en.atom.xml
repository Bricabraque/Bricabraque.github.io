Anarchism does not advocate a state—in the original sense of the word—of anomy. But it is the State which perpetuates violence and disorder. Anarchy means the absence of both the State and the laws. Élisée Reclus would see it as the “higher expression of order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchism is not an anti-social nor individualist thought. On the contrary, anarchism represents the wish of a fair and free society, which can be reached only through the real freedom of the individuals whom society consists of. A fair and free society cannot be based on coercion. However, real freedom does not mean the power of doing what one wants at the expense of the others' freedom. Real and fair freedom is also for one to  willfully set restraints to its freedom, without them being commanded by any authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, anarchism is caricatured by those who cannot conceive of an organised and fair society without institutions such as private property, the State or the police, that most of anarchists reject. The republican ideology, statist and nationalist, prevails in the political discourse, wether on left-wing or right-wing, and it does not cease to be taught by its institutions, the first of them we face being the so-called “republican” school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchy is not equal to a society based on the survival of the fittest, as we may be often told being an anarchist or related to. This principle that “might is right”, we currently know it, strengthened by the capitalist mode of production and its neo-liberal version. Survival of the fittest will cease when we understand that competition and rivalry between individuals must give way to free cooperation. The end of its existence will be sealed by the withdrawal of the society based on classes, supposed races or privileged models of sexuality and gender. In short, when domination of some over others is nothing more than a bad memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchism is not utopist nor extremist, but it is radical, which means it considers the resolution of issues at their roots. We do not stop the boiling water from making the pot overflow differently than by turning the fire off. Thus, we cannot settle for wanting to solve issues which roots are deeply buried in our society's structures by amending or hacking them, but by destroying them to rebuild some better. We cannot reach social justice through laws or authoritarian institutions, for it would jeopardise our freedom as individuals. Thus, it is futile to blindly trust reformist projects such as rewriting the constitution and reforming the Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot settle for legal actions in order to reach our aspirations, that is, social justice and freedom. Overtaking the State must be done through realizing that its existence is not inavoidable nor essential, and that all of what results from it is no panacea. Overtaking the State also means overtaking its rules if they are in conflict with social justice and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot give in to anti-intellectualism nor to contempt for class. Knowledge must be open to everyone without being commanded to them. The only essential knowledge is that of skepticism and questioning, particularly regarding what seems obvious and acknowledged. For that knowledge allows us to analyse the ideological discourse without being leveraged by something other than our sole belief, and to know, to spot and finally to overtake the bias imposed to our thought by our position within the social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must decline every form of eugenics, in particular intellectual eugenics. Ambition can also work in the “refusal to make it” way, which can be a sign of wisdom and solidarity more than social failure or stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must not think that our opinion, our thought, can embrace an ideology in its entirety. What matters is not to be exemplary nor to be the goog learner of some “&lt;em&gt;dire-vrai&lt;/em&gt;” (tell-true), but to ensure consistency with our belief. Socrates would tell us that think is such as talk to oneself, and that what matters is not to agree with everyone around the world but rather to agree with oneself. Thus, anarchism, if it is based on some common principles, has nothing to do with a settled ideology. On the contrary, it is designed to be figured continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought does not tackle neither all of the topics which can be analyzed with an anarchist point of view nor all of the forms that anarchism can take. This may constitute another post on this web-log.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>about the nouveau parti anticapitaliste</title><link href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/en/npa.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-02-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>bricabrac</name></author><id>tag:bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu,2017-02-26:/en/npa.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32rXHenjHo"&gt;an interview of Philippe Poutou by a journalist of the on-line newspaper Mediapart&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://npa2009.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nouveau Parti Anti-capitaliste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s 2017 runner for President of the French republic, and I must say that I have been rather pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself as a libertarian anarchist. I do not believe in both the State and elections. Although they relayed a trotskyst thought, the words of the NPA's candidate highlighted the fact that both his party and his application for the Presidential election have wanted to exist during this electoral campaign with the aim of gathering the anticapitalism's activists and sympathizers, from libertarian anarchists to trotskysts, including zadists and revolutionary union activists. Poutou also talked about democracy, self-governance, internationalism, anti-racism, anti-sexism and anti-homophobia, environmental struggle, breaking with capitalism and the regaining of the political power by the exploited. In the end, what he said suggested a wish of emancipation from the State which we originally find in the Marxian political philosophy, by opposing the riot from the election – a paradox that the NPA's members accept deliberately. In short, many common points for a few divergences regarding my own political opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also emphasized the necessity of radicality incumbent upon us by criticizing in particular the protectionism which is very popular with the so-called “radical left” represented by &lt;em&gt;la France Insoumise&lt;/em&gt; and, a fortiori, Mélenchon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also talked about the issue of the far-leftist movements' scattering, within trade unions and diverse action groups, and about how they are used to praise their house, a final point which is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not vote for the NPA for I do not understand its wish to run for the National election. However, I would consider NPA's applications for local elections as positive moves in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_municipalism"&gt;libertarian municipalist&lt;/a&gt; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>how to git</title><link href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/en/how-to-git.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-02-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>bricabrac</name></author><id>tag:bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu,2017-02-23:/en/how-to-git.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a few days, I have signed up for a &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; in order to contribute to the translation of diverse free-software projects.

Even though I have already known its main idea, the proper using of the git version control system has always seemed to me as a complex and far-fetched process. However, I have seriously dug into it these least few days and have been gradually getting used to the various commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will draw here a brief reminder of the workflow that I have learnt and that I currently use when I contribute to a project which I am not the owner; that is, nearly all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forking et cloning the remote repository&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After forking the original project repository on Github, we need to clone the fork repo locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cd path/of/your/working/dir
git clone &amp;lt;fork-url&amp;gt;
cd &amp;lt;fork-dir&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we add a remote that will be named &lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;/code&gt; with the upstream repo's url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote add upstream &amp;lt;upstream-repo-url&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we check the remots with &lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt;, the terminal should return these lines :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;origin  https://fork.git (fetch)
origin  https://fork.git (push)
upstream    https://upstream-repo.git (fetch)
upstream    https://upstream-repo.git (push)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Making changes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps which follow the changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We update locally from the upstream repo and we create a new branch for the commit-to-be :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch upstream
git branch &amp;lt;new-branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We add the modified files to push to the commit queue :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git add &amp;lt;modified-file&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Commit :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;Commit message&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We push the commit to the fork repo we own :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin &amp;lt;new-branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We complete the operation by going back on Github to issue a pull request from the fork to the upstream repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Syncing a fork&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that stage, let us say the pull has been merged into the upstream repository by its owner. We now sync the fork with the upstream repo in order to be up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fetch the updates from upstream :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch upstream
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We go back to the master branch :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We merge the upstream/master branch with the local master branch :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git merge upstream/master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we push all the stuff to the remote fork :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At least, I do not like to work when constrained by a hierarchy ; under pressure from the competitive relationship between companies, the sacrosanct principle of economic liberalism and capitalist mode of production ; burdened by the weight of an unpleasant and unfulfilling job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make these consideratons while we are still a student without any working experience but a few internship and roughly two or three seasonal contracts is likely to make you feel down. Not yet fully entered in the labour market as an employee but already blasé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually no. I am talking about being an employee, but when you are a student with all the doors that are still open to you—thanks to your educational level—people are trying to lure you with other shapes of alienation at work: self-entrepreneurship, academic research or teaching, even 'ethical' wage-earning within young, trendy, dynamic, bio-friendly, leftist-but-not-too-far-because-extremes-are-evil companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what I want to talk about: this situation where, because of your academic educational background and a fortiori your cultural capital, you are to enter, unwillingly, the hybrid class which some would call the medium class: aware of the upper class privilege, but not aware of theirs ; aware of environmental, political and social issues, but without appreciate their incidence on the said issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the questions I am hardly able to answer to being a student and considering my beliefs: can I follow the pattern which I have been pre-determined to follow since I reached college—research and teaching—while maintaining a class consciousness? Aren't I to forget unavoidably that the acamedic status would have provided me new privilege to enjoy? Will I still have an enough critical thinking to take into account my social position in my vision in order not to be biased by a social confinement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fear is precisely that of believing that my educational level would allow me to work and still have a fulfilling life, because I would have the opportunity to do something that pleases me. For it is exactly the feeling that I get from the medium class, to which I already belong more or less: that of a class which is not aware of its position within the social hierarchy. This blindness is doubtless one of the reasons why any revolutionary process remains impossible today: how can it be possible to envisage another society whitout being conscious of the alienations from which we suffer and that we inflict to the others? Above all, how can it be possible to realize the urgent need of a societal shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, my interrogations about my immediate future illustrate the class struggle on my scale: even though I can find a strictly intellectual interest in pursuing my education up to the PhD and take pleasure in it, pride is also likely to make me seek a higher social status. I always refer this very consideration to an article published on an issue of CQFD, titled &lt;a href="http://cqfd-journal.org/Refus-de-parvenir"&gt;"Le refus de parvenir"&lt;/a&gt; (Iffik Le Guen, avril 2016), discussing the conscious refusal of seeking a higher social status within a system, quite often through work: kinf of an inverted ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I follow my interest in intellectual knowledge while hoping to keep my critical eye and my class consciousness, and use this knowledge in concrete forms of resistance, or should I turn now to more basic projects and closer to the struggle in a perspective of refusal to contribute to a system which revulses me?&lt;/p&gt;
