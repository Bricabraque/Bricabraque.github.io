I do not believe in both the State and elections. Although they relayed a trotskyst thought, the words of the NPA's candidate highlighted the fact that both his party and his application for the Presidential election have wanted to exist during this electoral campaign with the aim of gathering the anticapitalism's activists and sympathizers, from libertarian anarchists to trotskysts, including zadists and revolutionary union activists. Poutou also talked about democracy, self-governance, internationalism, anti-racism, anti-sexism and anti-homophobia, environmental struggle, breaking with capitalism and the regaining of the political power by the exploited. In the end, what he said suggested a wish of emancipation from the State which we originally find in the Marxian political philosophy, by opposing the riot from the election – a paradox that the NPA's members accept deliberately. In short, many common points for a few divergences regarding my own political opinion.</p><p>He also emphasized the necessity of radicality incumbent upon us by criticizing in particular the protectionism which is very popular with the so-called “radical left” represented by <em>la France Insoumise</em> and, a fortiori, Mélenchon.</p><p>He also talked about the issue of the far-leftist movements' scattering, within trade unions and diverse action groups, and about how they are used to praise their house, a final point which is interesting.</p><p>I will not vote for the NPA for I do not understand its wish to run for the National election. However, I would consider NPA's applications for local elections as positive moves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_municipalism">libertarian municipalist</a> perspective.</p></article><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/">version française</a></li><li>:: <a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/en/pages/contact.html">contact</a></li><li>:: <a href="https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu/en/pages/uncopyright.html">uncopyright</a></li><li> :: <a href="https://github.com/Bricabraque">github</a></li></ul></nav></footer></div></body></html>
