<p>Today, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32rXHenjHo">an interview of Philippe Poutou by a journalist of the on-line newspaper Mediapart</a>, the <a href="https://npa2009.org/"><em>Nouveau Parti Anti-capitaliste</em></a>'s 2017 runner for President of the French republic, and I must say that I have been rather pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I consider myself as a libertarian anarchist. I do not believe in both the State and elections. Although it relays a trotskyst thought, the words of the NPA's candidate highlighted the fact that both his party and his application for the Presidential election want to exist during this electoral campaign with the aim of gathering the anticapitalism activists and sympathizers, from libertarian anarchists to trotskysts, including zadists and union activists. Poutou also talked about democracy, self-governance, internationalism and anti-racism, anti-sexism and anti-homophobia, environmental struggle, breaking with capitalism and the regaining of the political power by the exploited. In the end, what he said suggested a wish of emancipation from the State which we originally find in the Marxian political philosophy, by opposing the riot from the election – a paradox that the NPA's members accept deliberately. In short, many common points for a few divergences regarding my own political opinion.</p>
<p>He also emphasized the necessity of radicality incumbent upon us by criticizing in particular the protectionism which is very popular with the so-called “radical left” represented by <em>la France Insoumise</em> and, a fortiori, Mélenchon.</p>
<p>He also talked about the issue of the far leftist movements'scattering, within trade unions and diverse action groups, of the habit they have to defend their house, a final point which is interesting.</p>
<p>I will not vote for the NPA for I do not understand its wish to run for the National election. However, I would consider NPA's applications for local elections as positive moves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_municipalism">libertarian municipalist</a> perspective.</p>
